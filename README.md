# bad-neural-net
This is my first attempt at making a neural net. This is definetly highly inefficient and a waste of computer resources. I made this to test my abilities.
Neural net works out of the box. If you want to use the saved weights and biases then remove quotes on line 7 and line 18 and add quotes before line 26 and after line 57
