# bad-neural-net
This is my first attempt at making a neural net. This is definetly highly inefficient and a waste of computer resources. I made this to test my abilities.
For this neural net to work you have to remove the quotes around lines 24 to 55. Then add quotes around lines 7 to 18. After you run the neural net once you can revert the quotes back to default so the neural net saves the previous weights and biases.
